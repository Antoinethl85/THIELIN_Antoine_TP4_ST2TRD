## Introduction

I wasn't able to test my code the last day because of internet issues (I changed home and doesn't have internet connection, I discovred 4g for my phone is enough for API calls). So, if Alger doesn't work, try the other cities because i changed nothing compare to the first version (when i had internet) that compiled perfectly. 

## In  your  point  of  view,  what was complicated  in  the  TP#2?  What  where  your  pain  points? What  could  you  do  when  expanding  this  TP  to avoid these  further?

I was not familiar with how to communicate with an API so it was a little challange for me to make it work. So the main part was the aync task to request data to the API in order to understand what it does. In this TP, I will try to make my code clearer and easiest to read.

## What are the S.O.L.I.D. principles?  What are the “KISS rule” and the “boy scout rule”?  What’s clean  code,  clean  architecture? 

SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make object-oriented designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable : Single-responsibility, Open–closed, Liskov substitution, Interface segregation, Dependency inversion.

KISS rule is a constant reminder to emphasize the simplest way forward. You adhere to KISS when you avoid attaching unnecessary steps to a process that doesn't need them.

The Boy Scout Rule can be summarized as: Leave your code better than you found it.

## How  would  you  expand  this  code? What can you add  to the software you build  to make it more useful, reliable, relevant to the user?  Find  5 ways to improve your previous  TP, even  if that’s not doable. 

If i can update this code, i would make a single window for each city and enable the user to type the city he wants (or enter coordinates). I also want to add icons for each infos on the city (wind, temperature, cloud, rain ...). I would like to enbale user to compare the city choosen with other ones in order for him to compare. And, I think the last thing I would implement is a text file as output of the user's research (for example, he receives a txt file of Paris's weather if he selected this city).
